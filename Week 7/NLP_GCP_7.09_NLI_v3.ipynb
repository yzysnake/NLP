    "## Zero Shot Learning Using Natural Language Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate **zero-shot** topic classification.  **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)** is being able to solve a task despite not having received any training examples of that task.  The `ZeroShotClassifier` class in *ktrain* can be used to perform topic classification with no training examples.  The technique is based on **Natural Language Inference (or NLI)** as described in [this interesting blog post](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) by Joe Davison.\n",

    "\n",
    "As stated above, the `ZeroShotClassifier` is implemented using Natural Language Inference (NLI).  That is, the document is treated as a **premise**, and each label is treated as a **hypothesis**.  To predict labels, an NLI model is used to predict whether or not each label is entailed by the premise.  By default, the template used for the hypothesis is of the form `\"This text is about <label>.\"`, where `<label>` is replaced with a candidate label (e.g., `politics`, `sports`, etc.).  Although this works well for many text classification problems such as the topic classification examples above, we can customize the template with the `nli_template` parameter if necessary.  For instance, if predicting sentiment of Yelp reviews, we might change the template as follows:"
